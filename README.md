# Project Introduction

This is a basic search application. It utilizes the powerful features of typescript, react, and redux to create a simple

## Caveat

This project is simply for improving my tender typescript skills and is by no means a representation of my complete
prowess in react and redux. ðŸ˜Š

## Tools

- React.js
- TypeScript
- Redux
